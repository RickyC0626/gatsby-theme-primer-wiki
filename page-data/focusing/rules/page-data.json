Meetings, talks.\n- Review read books on Goodreads & add it to [wiki](../books/books.md).\n\n## Licensing\n\n- License OSS code under [MIT](https://tldrlegal.com/license/mit-license) or [Apache 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n- License curated lists and everything else under [CC4](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).

Spacebar is always last key.\n\n## Naming\n\n- Twitter/Reddit/Instagram/GitHub, get literal name if available. On Twitter, lowercasing the name looks good (Twitter will show your custom real name in searches already). Can [capitalize](https://twitter.com/khanacademyeng) username if its multiple words (can rename username if needed). Capitalize [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ApolloApp/) subreddit name as it stands out better in searches & its more recognizable (the name can't be changed later so capitalize even if one word). GitHub is good [lowercased](https://github.com/learn-anything), literal name or with dashes. If name is taken, can add `_` or [HQ](https://twitter.com/SlackHQ)/[App](https://twitter.com/SparkMailApp)/[Inc](https://twitter.com/PlaybyteInc) in the end or prefix with [get](https://twitter.com/getairbridge) or [use](https://twitter.com/usefathom). For Instagram, if literal name is taken, it's possible to get domain name literal like [narative.co](https://www.instagram.com/narative.co/). Can use [namecheckr](https://www.namecheckr.com/) to check for available names.\n- For domains, get literal name, avoid dashes. Keep it to one registrar (Google Domains preferred). Prefer `.com`, ([vercel.com](https://vercel.com/)), `.co` ([vsco.co](https://vsco.co/)) or `.io` ([codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/)) for generic sites.

Developer related, `.dev` ([web.dev](https://web.dev)) is good. Organization, then `.org.` ([telegram.org](https://telegram.org/)). ML related, `.ai` ([deepcode.ai](https://www.deepcode.ai/)) can be good. Design related, `.design` is good ([baseweb.design](https://baseweb.design/)). Video related, `.tv` is good ([rewatch.tv](https://rewatch.tv/)). Otherwise, `.so`, ([notion.so](https://www.notion.so/)), `.xyz` ([learn-anything.xyz](https://learn-anything.xyz)), `.sh` ([apex.sh](https://apex.sh/)) are good.
