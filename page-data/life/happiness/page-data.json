They desynchronize the DMN which is responsible for consistency. Psychs may increase unconscious underworkings, or alternately, decrease the threshold required for these to manifest into consciousness. Social constructs are important for life and society. But ofcourse bad social constructs exist too. If they allow other sensory info to be considered, and other ideas to manifest, then you'll beable to see that our minds operate in a very fixed way. To relate to a study on LSD, they found that psychs increase entropy of language/semantics.
