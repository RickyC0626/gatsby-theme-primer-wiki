I always had this nagging thought in my head that I HAVE to earn money to prove my existence to people. To pay off the amazing things that my parents provided me in life. Paid education, food, house and free time to do what I want. I always felt guilty for having these privileges in life and I always felt that I owe it to them to be a good student. A smart adult who can not only pay off for his own life but help improve theirs. And it has been ever more depressing knowing that, I as 23 years old person can't do that for them. I can't even earn my own living, let alone pay off my education (which admittedly is not as bad as US or UK). I can't imagine what it feels like to be 40k+ in loans for an education that you hated. It's a horrible feeling. I do hope that something like Basic Income will one day be a reality.
