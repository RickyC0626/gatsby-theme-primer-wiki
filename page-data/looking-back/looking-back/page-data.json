Paid education, food, house and free time to do what I want. I always felt guilty for having these privileges in life and I always felt that I owe it to them to be a good student.

I can't even earn my own living, let alone pay off my education (which admittedly is not as bad as US or UK). I can't imagine what it feels like to be 40k+ in loans for an education that you hated.
