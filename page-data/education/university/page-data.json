Use office hours when in doubt\n\nIf the lecturer teaching the subject primarily does research in the subject and cannot teach to save his life. It may be best to study the material yourself and use the lectures as a supplementary material. It nearly always is a good idea to learn about the topic being taught in some way by either studying the lecture notes for the subject before attending the lecture.\n\nTo make your learning experience the best however, never ever be afraid to ask questions to either other students or asking the professor or student assistants directly during office hours.\n\n## 4. Keep track of assignments and deadlines\n\nI found [Trello](https://trello.com) to work really great for this. I had a Trello board I made where each column was a subject and I put what I had to do for each of the courses there with appropriate deadlines. Here is how that looked in one of my exam periods:\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/LArCADG.png)\n\nAlways use a calendar and plan your days ahead of you given the deadlines that are approaching. This is not helpful for just university but for life in general. The time you spend working and the things you work on during that time should ideally be predetermined already for you. You should just trust your schedule and do your part of the deal and study. I found creating [another Trello board named Focus](../focusing/focusing.md) helped me greatly in setting my inner compass and knowing what I should be doing in my life at all times.\n\n## 5. Take care of your health. Exercise. Eat proper food. Sleep more than 7 hours every day.\n\nHealth is very very important. Some students find their newly gained freedom to do things intoxicating. There is no one really there to say 'No' to you. You can buy chips and drink cola every evening of every day if you so wanted to. You can go out with friends every weekend and drink some. No one can stop you doing that except for you.\n\nOnly you can say no to that. You can decide to eat healthy and actually spend some time researching what does healthy eating even mean. I myself spend a good portion of my time in life asking this question. What it means to be healthy? Later I settled on a [whole food plant based diet](../health/nutrition/foods.md) with no foods with added sugar and no sugary drinks. Drinking only water and tea.\n\nMy vice of choice in university was [psychedelics](../drugs/psychedelics/psychedelics.md) as I found no other substance to entice me more than psychedelics. Leaving me with more questions after taking the drug than before. But even that is a slippery slope and you should control your intake of any substance you put into your body, be it a physically harmless psychedelic or alcohol or weed or some hard drug.\n\nOther than researching what foods to eat and what recipes you can cook from the many awesome foods there exist. I found exercising to be another very important investment of my time. I personally loved playing tennis and I had a friend who loved playing with me. But I would also sign up to the gym and start going there despite how intimidating it might first be. After a while you will actually enjoy your visits to the gym.\n\nAnd finally. Sleep. University is stressful. Deadlines are stressful. Exams are stressful. Juggling university & social life & leisure can be difficult. But despite all that, cutting away from sleep even for few hours every day will get you back. Eventually.\n\nIdeally learning the habit of going to sleep and waking up at the same time will pay huge dividends as you progress in both university and life.\n\n## 6. Apply for Google Summer of Code\n\nIf you are a CS student and want to spend the Summer wisely, it would be best to get some kind of internship or work experience. Google provides an amazing opportunity to work on any of the many awesome open source projects through its [GSOC program](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com). If you do apply, which all CS students really should try, you will get an opportunity to work on some open source project and actually put the knowledge you got in university into practice AND get paid while you do it. If you do put in the effort and work through it and not give up.\n\nFamiliarize yourself with [GSOC's timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) to know when projects get announced. What the deadline for your student application stating what you plan to work on during the Summer is. And start early. Look into [previous organizations that were chosen](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/organizations/). Very often same organizations pop up again and again. If you find any of them interesting, hop into their communication channels, often it maybe IRC or Slack and let them know that you want to help. Clone their project, try to build, look into some issues and try your hand at fixing some of them. Ask for help.\n\n## 7. Blog and share your learnings and what you know\n\nThis is a big one. I met many people who never shared what they knew in public form because they thought that what they knew has already been shared before. What's the point?\n\nThere is some truth to this. Especially once you start something new. Any 'Hello world' first blog post mostly looks the same. Introduce yourself to the world. Get yourself a public page on the internet and say hello. Say what you are interested in and why and you're done. You now have a blog.\n\nSometime during your crazy studies and life, you **will** get an idea or find something interesting. And now you have a place to write about it. I personally write [my articles](../sharing/my-articles.md) in [Medium](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev) and once I found myself to have a difficult time finishing majority of my articles because each one gets needlessly big. I started a [wiki](../README.md) and now I continuously share what I know with the world. My brain only knows how to solve problems given what I know. It doesn't retain a lot of facts and references because I can't trust it to do that. To me what is not written down is lost. And I think it is nice to share what you know or have learned so other people can find it too and save their time.\n\nI also found that, it is in the process of writing that you really understand what it is you know. As you try to put it to words, you cement the ideas you had floating in your head as you put them on paper for others and for yourself to read later.\n\nStarting a blog is super easy now. If you don't like Medium, you can [create your own blog on your own website](https://opensource.com/article/18/3/start-blog-30-minutes-hugo) with a static generator in just a few minutes. Oh and you will learn a lot in the process. Like what the hell is a static generator?\n\n## 8. Try new things\n\nThis applies more to life than university. But it really is the most powerful advice I can give to anyone. Just try new things. Don't be afraid. Start things. Solve your own problems.\n\nI personally fell in love with open source software and specifically optimizing everything in my life. macOS/iOS/life/time/productivity/.. Many of the projects I try to work on I do out of passion for solving my own itches I feel in life. I loved tinkering with macOS so much that I decided to [share my setup](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os) with the world. Little did I know then that is something that many people actually appreciate and liked. It felt great knowing that and finding it out for myself. If I didn't share it, this would literally simply not happen. If I didn't write my own 'Hello World' article on Medium, my blog wouldn't happen. If I didn't decide to start a wiki, [my wiki](../README.md) of now over 400 files would simply not happen.\n\nThere are many more things that simply would not happen if I didn't try new things. Fear is the worst reason to not do a thing.\n\n## Notes\n\n- [Having the ability to go to college isn't the same as having the opportunity to go to college and i am sick of acting like it is.](https://twitter.com/_thotology/status/1387769165780504578)\n\n## Links\n\n- [Should you go to university?
