At the top of the file you can have a section where you define your properties.

> Be aware that this section needs to be at the very top of the file to be valid

For example, for this file, we have:

[[daily-notes-1]]

```

type: feature
keywords: hello world

```

Those are properties.
Properties can be used to organize your notes.

[//begin]: # "Autogenerated link references for markdown compatibility"
[daily-notes-1]: daily-notes-1.md "daily-notes-1"
[//end]: # "Autogenerated link references"
